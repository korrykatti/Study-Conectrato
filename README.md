# Study-Conectrato
This will help you study and avoid moving mouse coz u dont need mouse for watching youtube videos. Neither u need it for pdfs just use your keyboard



# How to probably start it or make it work
1) you'd need tkinter3 to be installed ( already in latest python windows version)
2) sudo apt-get install python3-tk ( no need of this step in windows)
3) Then now we finally run it
4) python3 main.py ( for windows it is python only not python3 )





Nice enjoy i made this so that i study and dont open discord and chat
it gives you 60 seconds and then it starts . I made this to pass my chemistry test xD



i made a limited time version of it on request of @tupu4545 the file is pomodoro.py to start it follow the same steps but instead of main.py you have to type pomodoro.py  . I am thinking to make gui for it
